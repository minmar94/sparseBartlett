# A new hierarchical distribution on arbitrary sparse precision matrices
This repo includes data and code to reproduce the analysis in the paper _"A new hierarchical distribution on arbitrary sparse precision matrices"_, by G. Mastrantonio, P. Alaimo Di Loro and M. Mingione.

The work introduce a general strategy for defining distributions over the space of sparse symmetric positive definite matrices. In particular, the method utilizes the Cholesky factorization of the precision matrix, imposing sparsity through constraints on its elements while preserving their independence and avoiding the numerical evaluation of normalization constants. The new proposed prior is named **S-Bartlett**.
