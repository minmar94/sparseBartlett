## Overview
This repository contains the data used for the applications.

The first file, named "geneExpression.csv", has been used by Mohammadi and Wit (2015) and by van den Boom et al. (2002) and 
has data about gene expressions in B-lymphocyte cells from $n = 60$ individuals that have been quantile-normalized to marginally follow a standard Gaussian distribution. 

The second file by Borcard et al. (2011), named "doubs_data.xlsx", is about fish catches collected along the Doubs River and includes counts ($>0$) of fish species collected over 29 sampling hauls.
